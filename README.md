# Real Estate Tokenization

## Project Description

The Real Estate Tokenization smart contract enables fractional ownership of real estate properties through blockchain technology. Property owners can tokenize their real estate assets, allowing multiple investors to purchase fractional shares represented as ERC-20 tokens. This democratizes real estate investment by lowering entry barriers and providing liquidity to traditionally illiquid assets.

The contract manages property registration, token distribution, and ownership transfers while maintaining transparent records of all transactions on the blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the real estate investment landscape by:

- **Democratizing Access**: Making real estate investment accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial capacity
- **Enhancing Liquidity**: Converting illiquid real estate assets into tradeable tokens
- **Increasing Transparency**: Providing immutable records of ownership and transactions
- **Global Accessibility**: Enabling worldwide participation in real estate markets
- **Fractional Ownership**: Allowing investors to own portions of high-value properties

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Property Tokenization**
   - Property owners can tokenize their real estate assets
   - Define total property value and number of tokens to be issued
   - Automatic token minting and distribution to property owner
   - Immutable property records stored on blockchain

2. **Token Purchase System**
   - Investors can purchase property tokens using ETH
   - Dynamic pricing based on property value and token supply
   - Automatic ETH distribution to property owners
   - Excess payment refund mechanism

3. **Token Transfer Mechanism**
   - Seamless transfer of property tokens between addresses
   - Automatic balance tracking for all investors
   - Investor portfolio management
   - Transfer event logging for transparency

### Additional Features

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd real-estate-tokenization

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Usage

### Tokenizing a Property
```javascript
await contract.tokenizeProperty(
  "123 Main St, City, Country",
  ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), // 100 ETH property value
  10000 // 10,000 tokens
);
```

### Purchasing Tokens
```javascript
await contract.purchasePropertyTokens(
  1, // Property ID
  100, // Token amount
  { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") } // ETH payment
);
```

### Transferring Tokens
```javascript
await contract.transferPropertyTokens(
  1, // Property ID
  "0x...", // Recipient address
  50 // Token amount
);
```
